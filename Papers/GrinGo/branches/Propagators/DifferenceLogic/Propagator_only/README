%% ASP modulo Difference Logic %%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

BASIC CALL:
    clingo <script> <encoding> <instance> <options>
    
    Example:
        clingo differenceLogic.lp open_shop_dl.lp tai4_4_1.lp
        
SCRIPTS:
    differenceLogic.lp:
        Requires:
            - dl_lang.lp
            - x - y <= c --> &diff{x-y}<=c
        - solves ASP modulo difference logic programs
        Options:
          - number solutions controlled via clingo
          -c trace=1:
              - enables detailed output of theory propagation      
          -c state=1:
              - enables state-based negative cycle detection       
          -c negation=1:
              - enables strict semantic*  
          -c propagation=1:
              - enables full propagation*
              
*options might not work in conjunction with defined theory atoms (atoms in the head)
